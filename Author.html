        <p>
          <br>I have loved to draw since an early age and taught myself the basics of drawing. Because of ADHD, I have
          some difficulty focusing. In class I frequently drew comics because I found class boring, much to the
          annoyance of my school teachers. I started drawing when I was at least 5-6 years old, and I wanted to draw
          because I read books and watched videos, and wanted to draw the things I watched.
          <br> <strong> What inspired you to become a writer?</strong>
          <br>Reading books and watching cartoons as a kid.
          <br> <strong> What genres do you like to write in?</strong>
          <br>Mainly comedy-action, i always like to laugh.
          <br><strong>Are there any specific themes or messages you like to explore in your writing?</strong>
          <br>Not much.
          <br><strong>What are your aspirations as a writer?</strong>
          <br>I want to bring joy to others and make them laugh.
          <br><strong>Do you have any upcoming projects or books you’re working on?</strong>
          <br>More short comics about the nostalgia gang getting into hilarious incidents, probably Green vs AI part 2.
          <br><strong>What do you want readers to know about you?</strong>
          <br>I am just some guy who draws and writes for fun.
          <br><strong> Is there a fun fact or unique detail about yourself that you would like to share?</strong>
          <br>I’m just a pretty average guy, to be honest. I love reading, cartooning, but the special thing about me is
          that I have ADHD.

              My trashy website aims to share my (badly drawn) but awesome comics as part of my course project. I
              incorporated my favorite color (Green, Green, and more Green), stupid themes, and user-friendly navigation
              to engage visitors.<br><br>
